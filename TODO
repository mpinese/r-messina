Write vignette

Write all man page docs, with examples

Decide on biocViews for package

Complete NAMESPACE

Add literature references to docs

Integrate with Bioconductor (eg move to ESet)

Add dev.new for new graphics devices, to avoid kludging existing ones

Check that C-code complies with Bioc guidelines
If the package contains C or Fortran code, it should adhere to the standards and methods described in the System and foreign language interfaces section of the Writing R Extensions manual. In particular:
* Use internal R functions, e.g., R_alloc and random number generators, over system supplied ones.
( Use C function registration (See the Registering native routines)
* Use R_CheckUserInterrupt in C level loops when there is a chance that they may not terminate for 
  certain parameter settings or when their run time exceeds 10 seconds with typical parameter settings, 
  and the method is intended for interactive use.

In old C++ code:
  Add interrupt checks, and code to handle destruction gracefully in that case
