Write vignette

Decide on biocViews for package

Complete NAMESPACE

Add literature references to docs

Integrate with Bioconductor (eg move to ESet)

Decide on licence

Change cat output to message, unless in show method

Add dev.new for new graphics devices, to avoid kludging existing ones

Set version for final pre-submission to 0.99.0

Check that C-code complies with Bioc guidelines
If the package contains C or Fortran code, it should adhere to the standards and methods described in the System and foreign language interfaces section of the Writing R Extensions manual. In particular:
* Use internal R functions, e.g., R_alloc and random number generators, over system supplied ones.
( Use C function registration (See the Registering native routines)
* Use R_CheckUserInterrupt in C level loops when there is a chance that they may not terminate for certain parameter settings or when their run time exceeds 10 seconds with typical parameter settings, and the method is intended for interactive use.
* Make judicious use of Makevars and Makefile. These are often not required at all (See the Configure and cleanup).
Use of external libraries whose functionality is redundant with libraries already supported is strongly discouraged. In cases where the external library is complex the author may need to supply pre-built binary versions for some platforms.
