Description: Messina is a collection of algorithms for constructing optimally
    robust single-gene classifiers, and for identifying differential expression
    in the presence of outliers or unknown sample subgroups.  The methods have
    application in identifying lead features to develop into clinical tests
    (both diagnostic and prognostic), and in identifying differential
    expression when a fraction of samples show unusual patterns of expression.
